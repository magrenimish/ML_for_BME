# ML_for_BME
This repository includes updates on ML-based data insights that I am helping </br>
an NGO (Brightmind Enrichment and Schooling) achieve through the volunteer </br>
feedback they receive from their StreetCare App (https://streetcare.us/visit-log/).</br>
The NGO provides educational content and support for volunteers to help the </br>
homeless population. </br>
To show the impact of ML, I generated syntehtic feedback data and performed </br>
sentiment analysis on comments left by the users along with running binary </br>
classification models to predict if a volunteer would choose to repeat the </br>
service based on the input of location, time of year and previous experience </br>
of the volunteer.
